# Autonomous-vehicle

This repository shares the experiments used in our "Titulo" paper for replicability purposes:

(1) The "model" folder provides a folder "ExperimentalMutants" which includes the mutants used in this evaluation

(2) The "model" folder provides a folder "functions" which includes the functions needed to perform the execution

(3) The "model" folder provides a folder "data" which includes the data needed to run the experiments

(4) The "model" folder provides a file to execute test cases (METAMORPHIC_TESTING_EXPERIMENT_MAIN.m)

The requirements to execute the experiments can be found in the following web page:
